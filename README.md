# Data Mining Algorithms

Implementation of some data mining algorithms in C++:

1. Association Rule Mining (A priori algorithm)
2. Agglomerative Clustering - Complete Linkage, Group Average, Median Linkage, Single Linkage
3. Divisive Clustering - Centroid Linkage, Group Average, Median Linkage
4. Decision Tree - C45, CART, ID3
5. FP Tree
